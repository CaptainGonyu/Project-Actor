      Hello and welcome (there's alot of welcomes going on)! Thank you so much
      for taking the time out of your busy day/night to get to know me it means
      alot. So let's get started! I was born in
      <em>Oceanside, California</em> and my parents moved us to
      <em>Pasadena, CA</em> while I was still a baby of course. I am the
      youngest of <strong>one</strong> older brother whom is 5 years older than
      me. Then after sometime my parents decided to move AGAIN but this time to
      <em>Anza, CA</em>. "Where is Anza?" I'm sure your asking.. Anza is 45
      minutes east of Temecula, CA and Temecula is about 1 hour and 30 minutes
      or 2 hours from Los Angeles (depending on traffic). I went to school
      normally but I was deffently a shy guy. I mostky kept to myself and to my
      friends. I wasnt the athletic type more nerdy which means I really just
      wanted to play my games. Im very big into video games and anime. They've
      always been a sort of an escape for me. Playing video games made me
      realize that maybe I should persure this a career cause I did really love
      them. But soon realized that I needed to go to school and well.. school
      wasnt realy for me. One day as all senior kids do is sit around in a
      circle and ask each other what we want to do after high school. Once it
      was my turn to say what I wanted to do it was like a
      <em>Light buld</em> moment and i heard a <em>whisper</em> and it said
      "acting". I really didnt know whatto make of it cause again I was very
      shy. So after graduation my amazing mom found acting classes in Temecula
      so we went and they offered a free class. I gladly took that offer but I
      didnt expect it to be that very second. I was walked back and saw a stage
      and a bunch of kids a little younger than me (I was 17 at this point). We
      were all on stage doing exercises but I didnt think I was going to
      participate cause I was really there to watch but there I am some random
      older kid on a stage doing things I never had done before. I kid you
      not... I broke out in a COLD SWEAT! I have never done that before but
      guess what.. I loved it. Acting didnt come to me as a kid like most it
      came to me as a very young adult. But I didnt know where or what that path
      would hold for me. Fast forward I started a new acting class not too far
      from the first and this one offered a little more and there where kids
      relitivly close to my age. With this class and at this point in my life i
      had moved to LA to guess what... PERSUE ACTING cause I was a wide eyed 18
      year old and ready to work. Also I landed a manager from the first acting
      classes but thats a story for another time. And with me still taking
      acting classes in Temecula at this time I would commute from Torrance to
      Temecula every monday which was easy for me cause I didnt have a job yet
      in LA, so my only commitment were these acting classes. After some time my
      acting school was holding a Chrismas play so all the acting classes where
      to ut on a show infront of all the parents and staff. Thankfully my class
      was the last to go cause they knew how far of a drive I had to do. Our
      play was "A charlie Browns Chrismas" and some how I was casted as the man
      himself.. Charlie Brown. Shortly after the play they were holding a
      showcase for agents and managers to come and see the young talent. I
      participated and got the attention of 2 agents. Had meetings with them
      both but one said "You just dont have enough credits" which was the usual
      saying for me but by random luck I signed on with an agent from oceanside!
      Buuuut it was pretty short coming cause they only got me one audition and
      I never heard from them again. A little while after I moved to acting
      classes a lot closer and of which my headshot photographer reccommened so
      I started to attened. This was a big chage from the last two classes..
      these classes where and felt alot more professional. I definetlt felt out
      of place but everyone was super nice and there was someone else in the
      classes too wjo was just starting out as well. He and I got partnered up
      for a scene together. We ended up doing a scene from the movie "<em
        >John Q</em
      >". As time went on we rolled into the new year.. the craziest year for
      everyone 2020. I had stopped going to classes cause I felt as if I wasnt
      going anywhere then the world stopped. Fast forward I came to a point
      where I was 100% done with acting I was going to give it up but every time
      it would always circle back. Weather it be with friends, family, my
      friends family or meeting my mentor who happens to be an executive
      producer. Acting always came back around so this time Im little bit older
      and a little bit wiser and not afriad to fail cause what life has shown me
      is that it doesnt stop for anyone. Im not starting over.. Im starting with
      experiance. This got pretty long but when I get in the zone I zone out.
      Acting has been for me since before I was born so why change that about
      me. We're going to be on of the greats that films live on even after Im
      gone and I cant wait for this journey!
